# Number Guessing Game (Web Version)
This is a simple and fun web-based Number Guessing Game developed using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

# How to play:
The game randomly selects a number between 1 to 100, and users try to guess it through a clean web interface.
After each guess, the application provides whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct and keeps track of the number of attempts and the highest score achieved.

The project is lightweight and beginner-friendly, showcasing the integration of Flask with basic web technologies. 
It includes a game.py file that runs the Flask server, and a templates/index.html file that handles the user interface.

# How to run:
To run the game, install Python and Flask, then execute game.py and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
